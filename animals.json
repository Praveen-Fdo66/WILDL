    "name": "PURPLE-FACED LANGUR",
    "description": "The purple-faced langur (Semnopithecus vetulus), sometimes known as the purple-faced leaf monkey, is an indigenous Old World primate to Sri Lanka. The animal is a long-tailed arboreal species distinguished by its predominantly brown coloring, dark face (with whiter lower face), and shy demeanor. The species was once common in suburban Colombo and \"wet zone\" villages (areas with high temperatures and high humidity all year, with rain deluges during the monsoon seasons), but rapid urbanization has resulted in a significant decrease in the monkey population level. It was previously classified in the lutung genus Trachypithecus, but DNA evidence indicated that it is more closely related to Semnopithecus and closely related to the gray langurs.",

    "description": "The Sri Lanka blue magpie (Urocissa ornata) is a vividly colored member of the Corvidae family that is found only in Sri Lanka. This species has evolved to hunt in dense canopy areas, where it is highly active and nimble. Its flight, however, is quite weak, and it is rarely utilized to travel long distances. Despite the Sri Lanka blue magpie's capacity to adapt to human presence, it is classed as vulnerable to extinction due to fragmentation and degradation of its habitat of deep primary forest in southern Sri Lanka's wet zone.",
