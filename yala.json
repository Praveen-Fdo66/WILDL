      "title": "History of Yala National Park",
      "content": "Yala, Sri Lanka's most popular and second largest national park, has a long history of conservation in the country's east, dating back to the early twentieth century when it was first established as a wildlife refuge. The area was designated a national park in 1938 because it was home to a varied array of flora and fauna, including numerous endangered species such as elephants, leopards, and a diversity of bird species. The park suffered from poaching and illegal wildlife trafficking in the 1970s and 1980s, but conservation efforts by the Sri Lankan government and numerous non-governmental groups helped to safeguard and restore the park's environment. The 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami badly affected the national park.Many humans have been carried away, affecting the park's natural characteristics. Fortunately, the park has rebounded from this tragic tragedy and is now one of the most popular and accessible locations in Sri Lanka and throughout the world for visitors looking to see elephants and leopards up close. The park is separated into five zones, each with its own distinct features and animals. The most popular zones are 1 and 5, which are noted for their dense populations of wildlife, particularly leopards. The park can be entered through a variety of gates, but the Palatupana entry is the most popular. This gate is located near Tissamaharama and is the most easily accessible by public transit.",

      "content": "The leopard is the real star of the show. Yala National Park is one of the best sites in the world to witness these gorgeous animals in their natural habitat. They can be more elusive, but with a little patience and a keen eye, you should be able to find one or two. Elephants, gracefully strolling around the park, are another sight to behold, making a Yala National Park safari an excellent way to get up close and personal with these gentle giants. Keep your camera handy because there are many other species to see: lively monkeys tumbling through the trees, frightened deer hiding in the undergrowth, and massive crocodiles lounging on the banks of rivers. Bird lovers will be happy to learn that Yala National Park is home to over 200 bird species. During your tour, you will have numerous possibilities to observe birds, ranging from colorful peacocks to fearsome eagles. With so much wildlife to see, remember to bring your binoculars and telephoto zoom lens.",

      "title": "When is the best time to visit Yala National Park",
      "content": "As we describe in our '39 things to know before visiting Sri Lanka' essay, the island has not one, but two monsoon seasons each year, which affect separate sides of the island at different times of the year. The dry season, which lasts from February to July, is truly the only time to visit Yala National Park, as a shortage of water means lots of species to be observed around reservoirs. We visited in November, just as the park reopened, and while it was lush with green from the northeastern monsoon, we recommend a Yala National Park safari between February and July, when wildlife viewing opportunities are better due to a lack of water. Want to see a leopard? Between April and July, water levels are low, making leopards more active and visible. However, we did see one during our November vacation. Bird enthusiasts may favor the months of November through January, when there are many migratory birds to witness. Finally, the park can get fairly crowded (and we mean crowded!) between December and April, so if you want a more serene Yala National Park safari experience, go during the off-season. Regardless of the season, schedule your safari for early in the morning or late in the afternoon when the animals are most active. NOTE: The park is closed for a month between September and October for annual maintenance/drought prevention.",
