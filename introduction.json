    "p1": "Udawalawe National Park is a national park in Sri Lanka that borders the provinces of Sabaragamuwa and Uva. The park was established to provide a safe haven for wild creatures displaced by the construction of the Udawalawe Reservoir on the Walawe River, as well as to safeguard the reservoir's catchment area. The reserve, which spans 30,821 hectares (119.00 square miles), was established on June 30, 1972.",
    "p2": "Before the national park was established, the land was used for shifting agriculture (chena farming). Once the national park was established, the farmers were progressively relocated. The park is located 165 kilometers (103 miles) from Colombo. Water birds and Sri Lankan elephants use Udawalawe as a breeding ground. It is a well-known tourist site, and third-most visited park in the country.",
    "p3": "Set off on an unforgettable Sri Lanka safari in Udawalawe National Park. Explore huge landscapes and observe wildlife coexisting in harmony. Admire herds of stately elephants and take photographs of gorgeous raptors in their natural habitat. Allow the stunning beauty of Udawalawe to create memories that will last a lifetime.",
    "p4": "Because this glamping site is so close to the park's eastern edge, guests can have an experience that is very comparable to living inside the park. If you're lucky, you might even see wildlife in the campground. Elephants come to the campsite on a regular basis."

    "p1": "Sinharaja Forest Reserve is a forest reserve in Sri Lanka that is also a biodiversity hotspot. It has international significance and has been declared by UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site.",
    "p2": "Sinharaja is the country's last sustainable region of primary tropical rainforest, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). More over 60% of the trees are endemic, and many are endangered. 50% of Sri Lanka's indigenous animal species (particularly butterflies, amphibians, birds, snakes, and fish species). It is home to 95% of the world's indigenous birds.",
    "p3": "Because of its inaccessibility, the steep virgin rainforest, which is part of the Sri Lanka lowland rain forests ecoregion, was protected from the worst of commercial logging and was proclaimed a World Biosphere Reserve in 1978 and a World Heritage Site in 1988.",
    "p4": "Because of the lush foliage, wildlife is less visible than in dry-zone national parks like Yala. The endemic purple-faced langur is the most common bigger mammal.",
    "p5": "The courageous Sri Lanka crested drongo and the boisterous orange-billed babbler lead the way in mixed feeding flocks. The 20 rainforest species, including the elusive red-faced malkoha, green-billed coucal, and Sri Lanka blue magpie, are all found here.",
    "p6": "Reptiles include the indigenous green pit viper and hump-nosed viper, while amphibians, particularly tree frogs, are abundant. The endemic Sri Lankan birdwing butterfly and leeches are among the invertebrates."

    "p2": "Kumana National Park borders Yala National Park. Previously known as Yala East National Park, Kumana was renamed on September 5, 2006.",
    "p3": "Because of LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) attacks, the park was closed from 1985 until March 2003. It was also impacted by the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami.",

    "p4": "The national park's southern boundary is Kumbukkan Oya. The national park's considerable birdlife is supported by 20 lagoons and tanks. The lagoons are shallow, with depths of less than two meters (6.6 feet). Kumana villu is occasionally inundated with ocean. The area's elevation ranges from sea level to 90 meters (300 feet). The average annual temperature is 27.30 °C (81.14 °F), while the yearly rainfall is 1,300 millimeters (51.18 in)."
